                A <strong>lion</strong> was once sleeping in his <strong>den</strong> when a <strong>mouse</strong> started <strong>running up and down his body </strong>  
                just for fun. This woke up the <strong>lion</strong>, and he was quite angry.
                <br />
                <br />
                He was about to <strong>eat</strong> the <strong>mouse</strong> when the <strong>mouse</strong> pleaded with the <strong>lion</strong> to set him free. 
                ‚ÄúI promise you, I will be of great help to you someday if you save me.‚Äù The <strong>lion</strong> laughed 
                at the <strong>mouse</strong>‚Äôs confidence and let him go.
                <br />
                <br />
                One day, a few <strong>hunters</strong> came into the <strong>forest</strong> and trapped the <strong>lion</strong>. 
                The <strong>lion</strong> started to <strong>roar</strong> and struggled to free himself.
                <br />
                <br />
                Soon, the <strong>mouse</strong> walked past and noticed the <strong>lion</strong> in trouble. He ran and called his 
                friends for help. Together they <strong>gnawed on the ropes</strong> to set the <strong>lion</strong> free. They ran off 
                into <strong>the jungle</strong> and remain friends thereafter.
